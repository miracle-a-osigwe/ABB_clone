Project description
A clone of the famous AirBnB

We are developing the backend functions of the Airbnb product

First step is to develop the command kine interpreter using python


Brief overview of the command interpreter

the command interpreter is designed to work both in non-interactive and interactive sessions.

To start the cmd interpreter, use ./console.py

example 

$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)


to use the console, you can learn some basic commands by simply typing 'help',
as can be seen in the first example above
